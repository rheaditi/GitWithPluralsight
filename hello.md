HI! This is just some stuff and notes on what I learnt from git

This line of text only appears in master branch as of now
## Learnt Stuff:-

git  add <path>
	adds the contents of current path to the index
	-v for verbose

git branch
	shows current branches
	--color : show with colors

git checkout <branchname>
	change to that branch

git commit 
	commits changes from current index
	-a for interactive [opens vim]
	-m like "git commit -m 'commit message here'"


gitk --all
	the git repositiory browser
	shows a visualization of branches etc
